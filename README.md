# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of accelerometer data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined movements.  It is a challenging problem given the large number of observations produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate accelerometer data to known movements.
